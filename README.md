# Loan Data Classification

## Overview
This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to classify loan data, addressing class imbalance issues and comparing the performance of various models. The study evaluates Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest on both imbalanced and balanced datasets.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handles missing values, if any.
  - Balances the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).
- **Model Training:**
  - Implements SVC, KNN, and Random Forest.
  - Tunes hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy Score
  - F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- **Comparison:**
  - Evaluates the impact of class imbalance on model performance.

## Results
- Random Forest outperformed SVC and KNN in terms of both accuracy and F1 score.
- Balanced datasets significantly improved model performance across all metrics.
